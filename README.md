Inspired by https://github.com/anvaka/fieldplay

Test run video at: https://youtu.be/CTr70bCo-iU?si=c7fckQACTprddSih and https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Sy2OXvMilId28cgoLQ3Mg-SGIFVbB38

Not exactly a Java port of anvaka's work, though.

Intended to be as flexible as possible

To run on local system, first clone the repository. Edit the Test.java file, you can change the DemoVectorFields.UNDULATING part with other DemoVectorFields (You can even create your own AnimatedVectorField, see the DemoVectorFields.java file to get an idea on how to do so). Run the Test.java file.

Works best with GPU acceleration.
